We will then discover the various components of Three.js and once the basics are acquired, we will move on to more advanced techniques to display millions of particles, add physics, add interactions, create a galaxy, animate a raging sea, etc.At the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of Three.js and enough experience to start your own projects. As a bonus, we will also learn how to use the 3D software Blender to be able to create our own models.3D Telescope illustration ",
